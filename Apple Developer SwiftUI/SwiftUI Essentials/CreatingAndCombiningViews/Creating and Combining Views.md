# SwiftUI Essentials: Creating and Combining Views

## Preface from Apple
To follow the [Creating and Combining Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views) tutorial, you'll create a new Xcode project as described in the first section of the tutorial. When prompted by the tutorial, you'll need the image in the **Resources** folder. To explore on your own, open the Xcode project in the **Complete** folder and browse the project's code.

- Note: To preview and interact with views from the canvas in Xcode ensure your Mac is running macOS 11 or later.

## Introduction
This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an app for discovering and sharing the places you love. You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details.

To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component. As you refine the view’s design, Xcode provides real-time feedback so you can see how those changes translate into code.
